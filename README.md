# Fogbound Maze

Fogbound Maze is a Unity 6 third-person and first-person survival maze game.
The player starts at the title screen, selects an unlocked level, then chooses
a pistol or machete outside a procedurally generated maze,
enters through the start gate, survives zombie attacks, and reaches the exit.

## Portfolio Scope

- Ten deterministic, progressively harder maze levels
- Title screen, ten-level selection and locally saved sequential completion
- Animated survivor and two zombie models from the Quaternius CC0 kit
- Runtime maze generation with guaranteed start-to-exit connectivity
- Branch-rich Growing Tree mazes with early route choices
- Fog-of-war mini-map showing visited cells and unexplored exit mouths without revealing the solution
- Switchable first-person and third-person cameras
- Ranged and melee weapons with distinct risk/reward
- Grid A* navigation and explicit zombie AI states
- Normal and elite zombie variants backed by object pooling
- Fog, day/night cycling, miasma damage and safe-light zones
- Keyboard/mouse and Android touch controls
- Windows, WebGL and Android release targets
